      "privacy": {
        "question": "How is my data protected?",
        "answer": "Your privacy is our top priority. WHPH stores all data locally on your device by default. We don't collect, track, or store any personal information on external servers. Optional cloud sync is available through your own cloud storage providers (like Google Drive or Dropbox) if you choose to enable it, giving you full control over your data."

We also welcome designers, documentation writers, and anyone interested in improving productivity tools."
      },
      "sync": {
        "question": "How do I sync data between devices?",
        "answer": "WHPH offers optional data synchronization between your desktop and mobile devices over your local network. You can sync your tasks, habits, and progress data directly between devices without any cloud services. All synchronization happens locally, ensuring your productivity data remains completely private and never leaves your network."
      },
      "offline": {
        "question": "Does WHPH work offline?",
        "answer": "Absolutely! WHPH is designed to work completely offline. All your tasks, habits, and analytics are stored locally on your device. You can use every feature without an internet connection. Local network sync is only used when you explicitly enable it and only works with devices on the same network."
      },
      "backup": {
        "question": "Can I backup and restore my data?",
        "answer": "Yes, WHPH provides comprehensive backup and restore support. You can easily backup all your tasks, habits, and progress data, and restore them when needed. Additionally, you can export your data in CSV and JSON formats as needed. This way you can keep your data safe and use it with other tools."
      },
      "workHardPlayHard": {
        "question": "What does the \"Work Hard Play Hard\" motto mean?",
        "answer": "\"Work Hard Play Hard\" is a motto that encourages individuals to balance high responsibility with high life satisfaction. So take your work seriously, but also truly rest, have fun, and live during your free time. Work isn't just about making money, but about growing and finding fulfillment; having fun isn't laziness, but the natural reward of effort. As WHPH, we also value both productive work and consciously celebrating successes. Now that you know what this motto means, you can listen to [David Guetta](https://youtu.be/5dbEhBKGOtY) or [Wiz Khalifa](https://youtu.be/TWHNr0BrNgo)'s songs on this topic."
