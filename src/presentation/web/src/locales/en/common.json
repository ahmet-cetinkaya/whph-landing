        "question": "Is WHPH really free?",
        "answer": "Yes, WHPH is completely free and open source. There are no premium tiers, subscription fees, or hidden costs. You get access to all features without any limitations. The app is funded by community contributions and developed by volunteers who believe productivity tools should be accessible to everyone."
      },
      "platforms": {
        "question": "What platforms are supported?",
        "answer": "WHPH is available on Android, Windows, and Linux. You can download it from our GitHub releases, F-Droid (for Android), or compile from source. We're working on iOS and macOS support, but they're not available yet due to development resource constraints."
      },
      "privacy": {
        "question": "How is my data protected?",
        "answer": "Your privacy is our top priority. WHPH stores all data locally on your device by default. We don't collect, track, or store any personal information on external servers. Optional cloud sync is available through your own cloud storage providers (like Google Drive or Dropbox) if you choose to enable it, giving you full control over your data."
      },
      "contribute": {
        "question": "How can I get help or contribute?",
        "answer": "Join our GitHub Discussions for community support, feature requests, and general questions. If you're a developer, you can contribute code, report bugs, or help with translations on our GitHub repository. We also welcome designers, documentation writers, and anyone interested in improving productivity tools."
      },
      "sync": {
        "question": "How do I sync data between devices?",
        "answer": "WHPH offers optional data synchronization between your desktop and mobile devices over your local network. You can sync your tasks, habits, and progress data directly between devices without any cloud services. All synchronization happens locally, ensuring your productivity data remains completely private and never leaves your network."
      },
      "offline": {
        "question": "Does WHPH work offline?",
        "answer": "Absolutely! WHPH is designed to work completely offline. All your tasks, habits, and analytics are stored locally on your device. You can use every feature without an internet connection. Local network sync is only used when you explicitly enable it and only works with devices on the same network."
      },
      "backup": {
        "question": "Can I backup and restore my data?",
        "answer": "Yes, WHPH provides comprehensive backup and restore support. You can easily backup all your tasks, habits, and progress data, and restore them when needed. Additionally, you can export your data in CSV and JSON formats as needed. This way you can keep your data safe and use it with other tools."
      },
      "workHardPlayHard": {
        "question": "What does the \"Work Hard Play Hard\" motto mean?",
        "answer": "\"Work Hard Play Hard\" represents not just a lifestyle, but a worldview. This motto suggests balancing high responsibility with high life satisfaction. It means 'Give your all at work, but live life to the fullest when you're not working.' This philosophy argues that work should be for self-realization, not just survival, and that fun is not laziness but the natural reward of effort. As WHPH, we aim to help you be more productive at work and consciously celebrate your achievements. The key point: live both areas consciously. You should live as much as you work, but living shouldn't just be the reward of working. Now that you've learned what this motto means with new understanding, you can enjoy [Wiz Khalifa's song](https://youtu.be/TWHNr0BrNgo)."
